# Applied_ML_with_5_different_algorithms

Applied 5 different algorithm on Titanic Dataset to build model to predict which people would survive based on some given attributes. To solve this classification problem used the following angorithms and then compared model results and final model selection was done. Logistic Regression Algorithm, Support Vector Machines Algorithm, Multilayer Perceptron Algorithm, Random Forest, GradientBoosting
